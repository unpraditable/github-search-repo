# üìò GitHubSearchApp Test Documentation

This document explains how to run and understand the unit tests written for the `GithubSearchApp` React component.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Ensure the following packages are installed in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

If you‚Äôre using Create React App, these are already preconfigured.
If using Vite or Webpack manually, you may need to configure `jest.config.js` and set up Babel or ts-jest.

---

## üìÇ Test File Location

Create the test file next to your component:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.test.tsx
```

---

## üöÄ How to Run the Tests

Using NPM:

```bash
npm test
```

Or run a specific test file:

```bash
npx jest App.test.tsx
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn test
```

## ‚úÖ What is Covered

### 1. **Basic UI Rendering**

- Ensures the search input and button are visible on screen.

### 2. **Search Functionality**

- Mocks GitHub API fetch calls.
- Simulates user typing and clicking the Search button.
- Verifies:
  - The correct username is rendered.
  - Repositories are listed with name, description, and star count.

### 3. **Validation**

- Prevents search API call if input is shorter than 2 characters.

## üîé Example Output Snapshot

After typing `octocat` and clicking search:

```
> Hello-World
My first repository on GitHub!
‚òÖ 42 stars
```

---

## üß™ Test File Highlights

### Mock Fetch:

```ts
(global.fetch as jest.Mock).mockImplementation((url) => { ... });
```

### Interaction:

```ts
fireEvent.change(input, { target: { value: "octocat" } });
fireEvent.click(button);
```

### Assertions:

```ts
expect(screen.getByText("Hello-World")).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.getByText("42")).toBeInTheDocument();
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tips

- Always reset fetch mocks between tests with `jest.clearAllMocks()`.
- Use `await waitFor(...)` when testing async fetch results.
- Use `screen.debug()` for manual troubleshooting output.
